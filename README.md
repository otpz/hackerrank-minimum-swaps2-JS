# hackerrank-minimum-swaps2-JS
JS solution of minimum swaps 2 algorithm from Hackerrank array questions.

The difficulty of the problem is medium, but the solution is very short.
In order to find the minimum swaps in the question, all we have to do is find the index with the number that is not where it should be and swaps it with the number in that index. That's my JavaScript solution.
